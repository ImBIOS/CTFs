# picoCTF 2021 Writeups

picoCTF 2021 is the largest cybersecurity hacking competition for middle and high school students. Participants 13 years and older of all skill levels are encouraged to compete. Competitors must reverse-engineer, break, hack, decrypt, and think creatively and critically to solve the challenges and capture the digital flags.

I was not present for the live event of this CTF. These writeups is for my "study" in this cybersecurity journey and of course I am reading some reference to be able to answer and write those writeups.
