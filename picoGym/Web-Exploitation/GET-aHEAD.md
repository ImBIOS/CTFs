# GET aHEAD

**Description:** Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition

**Points:** 20

**Solution**

At first reading the name of this challange makes me wondering that is the key to get through this challange. At first try, I just able to change the pages color from red to blue and _vice versa_.

Nothing I found is useful except a clue that when I read this page HTML code, there is 2 method to communicate with the backend of this website: `POST` and `GET` method.

```html
<div class="col-md-6">
  <div class="panel panel-primary" style="margin-top:50px">
    <div class="panel-heading">
      <h3 class="panel-title" style="color:red">Red</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <form action="index.php" method="GET">
        <input type="submit" value="Choose Red" />
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
  <div class="panel panel-primary" style="margin-top:50px">
    <div class="panel-heading">
      <h3 class="panel-title" style="color:blue">Blue</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
      <form action="index.php" method="POST">
        <input type="submit" value="Choose Blue" />
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

I can't solve this challange until I read `abbasmj`'s writeup about this challange. There is a **HEAD** method for api communication. Then, when we call it using `curl`, the Flag is popped out! yey!

```bash
curl -I HEAD -i http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/index.php
```

**Flag:** picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_2e5ba39f}
