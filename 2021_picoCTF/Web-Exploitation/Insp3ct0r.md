# Insp3ct0r

**Description**

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

**Points:** 50

**Solution**

`TL;DR` open the html, css, and js code. And... what? It is not the full flag yet.

You'll find these string in the html, css, and the js file.

```html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```

```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

```js
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

It seems, it is more complex than the [Cookies](./Cookies.md) challange. But the javascript file give us a clue, and it is very stright forward that we can trust the `robots.txt` is the answer here. And here is the string from the `robots.txt` file:

```
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

Then I wonder, what the "hack" is -or I think- what file is should be in the apache web folder with its default installation, then I open another writeups to figure it out, and `.htaccess` is the answer:

```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

You might ever found this silly file when you open some folder and find out something that is useless but often to see it when you have many "creative" things downloaded from the internet. of course, `.DS_Store` is our next friend here.

```
Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _fa04427c}
